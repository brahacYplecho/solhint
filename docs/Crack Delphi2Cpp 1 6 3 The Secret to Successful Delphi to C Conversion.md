If you are a Delphi developer who wants to migrate your code to C++, you might be interested in Delphi2Cpp 1.6.3, a software solution that helps you convert Delphi 7 source code to C++. Delphi2Cpp 1.6.3 is developed by Detlef Meyer-Eltz, and it can be downloaded from [Softpedia](https://www.softpedia.com/get/Programming/Other-Programming-Files/Delphi2Cpp.shtml) or [Free Download Manager](https://en.freedownloadmanager.org/Windows-PC/Delphi2Cpp.html). The software is not free, but you can try a demo version without time limit from [Text Transformer](https://www.texttransformer.com/D2C_Download_en.html).
 
Delphi2Cpp 1.6.3 aims to keep the amount of manual post-processing of the converted code as small as possible. However, you will need to make the correct settings in the dialog for the translation options, such as choosing the output compiler, adjusting the processing options, picking the substitutions, and enabling special treatment for some VCL functions. You will also need to check the translated code for errors and make necessary corrections.

Delphi2Cpp 1.6.3 supports many features of Delphi, such as classes, interfaces, properties, generics, exceptions, RTTI, and more. It also supports some extensions of C++, such as multiple inheritance, templates, and STL. However, some features of Delphi are not supported by C++, such as nested classes, class helpers, anonymous methods, and attributes. In these cases, Delphi2Cpp 1.6.3 will try to find a workaround or insert comments in the translated code.

Delphi2Cpp 1.6.3 is a useful tool for Delphi developers who want to port their code to C++. However, it is not a magic solution that can do everything automatically. You will still need to have some knowledge of C++ and be prepared to do some manual work after the conversion. If you are looking for a fast and easy way to migrate your Delphi code to C++, you might want to give Delphi2Cpp 1.6.3 a try.
  
If you want to learn more about Delphi2Cpp 1.6.3, you can visit the official website of the developer at [Text Transformer](https://www.texttransformer.com/Delphi2Cpp_en.html).

You can also find some examples of Delphi code and its corresponding C++ code after the conversion. You can also contact the developer if you have any questions or suggestions about the software.
 
Delphi2Cpp 1.6.3 is not the only tool that can help you convert Delphi code to C++. There are other alternatives that you can try, such as [DelphiToCpp](https://www.dr-lex.be/software/delphitocpp.html), [DelphiToC](https://github.com/nielsAD/DelphiToC), or [DelphiToC](https://github.com/nielsAD/DelphiToC). However, each tool has its own advantages and disadvantages, and none of them can guarantee a perfect conversion. You will need to compare them and choose the one that suits your needs best.
 
Converting Delphi code to C++ can be a challenging task, but it can also bring some benefits, such as cross-platform compatibility, performance optimization, and access to more libraries and frameworks. If you are a Delphi developer who wants to switch to C++, you might want to consider using Delphi2Cpp 1.6.3 or another similar tool to make the process easier and faster.

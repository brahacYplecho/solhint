## Features of WOODexpressrar
 
WOODexpressrar has a user-friendly graphic interface that lets you design roof trusses and elements of timber structures in a few steps. You can choose from ready roof models, such as mono-pitch roofs, coupled roofs, close coupled roofs, trussed rafter roofs, attic trusses, and trusses with carpentry joints. You can also specify the main dimensions, loads, material properties, and design code parameters of your structure.
 
WOODexpressrar performs a finite element analysis of the truss structure, taking into account the stiffness of the connections and the natural frequencies of the roof trusses. It evaluates the loads according to Eurocode 0 and 1, and considers all the load combinations. It checks the strength and stability of the timber elements and connections in ultimate limit state of design, according to EN 1995-1-1:2008. It also checks the deflections in serviceability limit state, according to EN 1995-1-1:2008.
 
WOODexpressrar generates detailed reports with calculations and references to the corresponding design code paragraphs. It also produces automatic drawings of the truss structure and the connections, which you can customize, preview, print, or export to DXF and PDF files.
